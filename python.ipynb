        "* (Multiplication): Multiplies two operands. Example: 6 * 7 results in 42.\n",
        "/ (Division): Divides the first operand by the second. Example: 15 / 3 results in 5.0.\n",

        "> (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right. Example: 8 > 3 results in True.\n",
        "< (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right. Example: 2 < 7 results in True.\n",
        ">= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right. Example: 5 >= 5 results in True.\n",
